      <p>The universal gravitation law states that all matter, no matter the size, attracts every other bit of matter. Every object has a gravitational pull. When an object has a large mass and is very dense, it is going to have a stronger gravitational pull. If you have two objects with some mass, they will slowly come together. </p>
